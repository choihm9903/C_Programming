 general-purpose, procedural computer 
 programming language supporting 
 structured programming, 
 lexical variable scope, and recursion, 
 while a static type system prevents 
 unintended operations. 
 By design, C provides constructs that 
 map efficiently to typical machine 
 instructions and has 
 found lasting use in applications 
 previously coded in assembly language. 
 Such applications 
 include operating systems and 
 various application software for 
 computers, from supercomputers 
 to embedded systems.
